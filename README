About
-----
asciifire is an implementation of the classic fire effect in javascript.
It renders the flames in ascii text.

Usage
-----
To use the script in your web page:
1. Include the script in your source.
2. Place a <pre id="fire">Loading...</pre> tag where you want the effect to appear.
3. Call the ascf_setup(width, height) function to setup the effect.
4. Call the ascf_render() function to initiate the animation.

There are some functions that can be used to change the behaviour of the effect. For 
more on this please consult the source code.

Palette
-------
If you choose to use a custom palette you should take into consideration that
a good palette is vital to the quality of the effect. Below are some tested 
palettes that produce nice results.
