About
-----
asciifire is an implementation of the classic fire effect in javascript.
It renders the flames in ascii text.

Usage
-----
To use the script in your web page:
1. Include the script in your source.
2. Place a <pre id="fire">Loading...</pre> tag where you want the effect to appear.
3. Call the setupFire(width, height) function to setup the effect.
4. Call the fire() function to initiate the animation.

Optionally you can:
1. Use the reversePalette() to reverse the palette.
2. Use the setTransparency(setting) to control the transparency.
